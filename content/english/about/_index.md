#### With the Retail Investor In Mind

The retail investor often collaborates, shares information, leanings, tips and insights in online forums.  It is in the online communities where the idea of using R programming for portfolio tracking originates.  A recurring theme raised by many new investors in the forums is how to track and analyze portfolios.  There are plenty of options available for portfolio tracking available ranging from DYI spreadsheets to robust online services.  

One problem remains consistent in these options.  That problem is many of these options require cumbersome steps in preparing, maintaining and administering the data for these options to be useful. Why not be part of the solution?
