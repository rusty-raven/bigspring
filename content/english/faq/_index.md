{{< faq "The report is not running properly after uploading my data, what gives?" >}}
Most likely the data has been provided in a format other than .csv or the .csv file that has been provided does not meet the expected format for the application to work with. An example file with the content the application is designed to work is [available for download](files/MYPORTFOLIO.zip). Additional details about the data format is available on the [getting started](getstarted) page.

{{< faq "Are you keeping a record of my supplied data?" >}}
No user portfolio data is kept by this service.  This is the reason why users of the service provide their data when an analysis is wanted via an upload rather than keeping a local database of all user's investment details.  The active session is removed as soon as the user leaves the website.

{{< faq "Do you accept requests for new features in the service?" >}}
We are interested to [hear what you have in mind](/contact) for features and enhancements.  The only thing we ask is that you keep our guiding principles of **Value for Money**, **Meaningful Metrics** and keeping a **Simple Interface** in mind with any suggestions.    Development requests fitting those criteria will certainly be considered as future enhancements providing value-add to the service.

{{< faq "Do you provide refunds?" >}}
At this point the service is free, so no refunds are offered obviously.  Should there ever come a time when the service is subscription fee-based a refund policy will be part of that subscription agreement.
