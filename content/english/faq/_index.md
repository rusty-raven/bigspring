To use the dashboard select the 'CSV File Upload' function just above the dashboard application on the Dashboard page.  The Steps to [get started](getstarted) page provides additional detail to help with data format questions.

A template file with the data format expected by the dashboard is available for [download](files/MYPORTFOLIO.zip). Edit the template with your data and uploaded via the CSV File Upload function.

{{< faq "The report is not running properly after uploading my data, what gives?" >}}
Most likely the data has been provided in a format other than .csv or the .csv file that has been provided does not meet the expected format by the application.  An example file with the content the application is designed to work is [available for download](files/MYPORTFOLIO.zip). Additional details about the data format is available on the [getting started](getstarted) page.
