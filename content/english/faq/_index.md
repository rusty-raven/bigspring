To use the dashboard select the 'CSV File Upload' function just above the dashboard application on the Dashboard page.  The Steps to [get started](getstarted) page provides additional detail to help with data format questions.

A template file with the data format expected by the dashboard is available for [download](files/MYPORTFOLIO.zip). Edit the template with your data and uploaded via the CSV File Upload function.

{{< faq "The report is not running properly after uploading my data, what gives?" >}}
Most likely the data has been provided in a format other than .csv or the .csv file that has been provided does not meet the expected format for the application to work with. An example file with the content the application is designed to work is [available for download](files/MYPORTFOLIO.zip). Additional details about the data format is available on the [getting started](getstarted) page.

{{< faq "Are you keeping a record of my supplied data?" >}}
No user portfolio data is kept by this service.  This is the reason why users of the service provide their data when an analysis is wanted via an upload rather than keeping a local database of all user's investment details.  The active session is removed as soon as the user leaves the dashboard web page.
