    content: Not sure that reinventing mainstream portfolio reporting and analysis is the best description of this service but it is fun to think it is disruptive to a degree!  A simple, effective approach to providing meaningful insights to the retail investor is the mission.  If NOT being big on providing sizzle with no value-add is disruptive, fair enough, disruptive this service is.
